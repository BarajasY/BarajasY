Hello! You've found my personal coding space. Allow me to introduce myself first!

My name is Yahir Moreno Barajas! I'm a mexican beginner web developer, mainly focusing in the frontend side of things, but eventually planning to try my best as a full stack dev.

I live in a somewhat small town in MÃ©xico named Monclova, currently that's the site im planning to work in.

I'm heavily interesed into learning all about React.js, i believe it's a really powerful tool and so i want to get advantage of its potential. I'm currently trying to learn GraphQL, Express and Typescript. And also trying my best at doing animations in sites i have already built.
